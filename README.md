This project contains scripts and rules to enable iRODS to use bagit collections and objects.  
The file packaging format "bagit" is a IETF standard: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8493.   
In this project the following library/CLI tool is used to deal with bagit folders and files: https://github.com/fair-research/bdbag  
The main objective of the project is to provide an utility that enables iRODS (irods.org) to pack and unpack bagit compliant packages.
